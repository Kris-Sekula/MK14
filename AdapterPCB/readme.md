This is a project of an adapter PCB that combines the work of two other projects into a single PCB:
1. "A simple RAM and EPROM adapter for SoC MK14" - as described by Martin on [8bit.cz](https://www.8bity.cz/2015/jednoduchy-ram-a-eprom-adapter-pro-soc-mk14/)
2. "A four-chip "Micro Introkit" running KitbugPlus" - as described by Phil on [philg.uk](http://www.mccrash-racing.co.uk/philg/picl/picl.htm)

My contribution is the combined PCB.

In the Hardware folder, you will find the Gerbers required to produce the PCB.
In the GAL folder, you will find the '.jed' files that can be used to program the GAL depending on the mode you are planning to run the PCB (either as an expansion of MK14 to replace the RAM/ROM or as a KitBugPlus PCB)
