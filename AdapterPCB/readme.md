This is a project of and adapter PCB that combines work of two other projects into a single PCB:
1. "A simple RAM and EPROM adapter for SoC MK14" - as described by Martin on on ![8bit.cz](https://www.8bity.cz/2015/jednoduchy-ram-a-eprom-adapter-pro-soc-mk14/)
2. "A four-chip "Micro Introkit" running KitbugPlus" - as described by Phil on ![philg.uk](http://www.mccrash-racing.co.uk/philg/picl/picl.htm)

My contribution is the combined PCB - at some point I will share gerbers and the details of the project, for now you get order PCBs via PCBWay.
